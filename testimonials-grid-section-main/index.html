              I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
              current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel
              I got every penny’s worth.

              “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I
              signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun!
              The next 12 weeks were the best – and most grueling – time of my
              life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched
              careers as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”
